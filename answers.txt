# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

We found that if a peer requested a file with a really long file name
it would cause a buffer overflow. This would also occur if a given file
name from the command line argument was long enough. We prevented
these issues by ensuring that the filenames are within the right size.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

We fixed the issue that arose when a tracker had many peers(popular tracker).
We did so by making a dynamic array that was reallocated accordingly.
We ensured that a peer could not send us a file of infinite length.
We also protected ourselves from peers that would try to access outside 
directories.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
